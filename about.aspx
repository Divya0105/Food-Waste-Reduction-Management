            The Akshaya Patra Foundation is an NGO in India headquartered in Bengaluru. Our
            organisation strives to eliminate classroom hunger by implementing the Mid-Day Meal
            Scheme in the government schools and government-aided schools. Alongside, Akshaya
            Patra also aims at countering malnutrition and supporting the right to education
            of socio-economically disadvantaged children. Since 2000, Akshaya Patra has been
            concerting all its efforts towards providing fresh and nutritious meals to children
            on every single school day. We are continuously leveraging technology to multiply
            our reach. The state-of-the-art kitchens have become a subject of study and have
            attracted curious visitors from around the world. Our partnership with the Government
            of India and various State Governments, along with the persistent support from corporates,
            individual donors, and well-wishers have helped us to grow from serving just 1,500
            children in 5 schools in 2000 to serving 2 million children. Today, Akshaya Patra
            is the world’s largest (not-for-profit run) Mid-Day Meal Programme serving wholesome
            food every school day to over 2 million children from 22,367 schools across 15 states
            &amp; 2 Union territory of India.<br />
